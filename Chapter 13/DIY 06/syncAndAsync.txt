To understand the difference between synchronous (sync) and asynchronous (async) functions, let's break it down in a way that's easy

1. Synchronous (Sync) Function:
What it is: A synchronous function runs step-by-step, one after another. Each line of code must finish before the next line starts. It’s like following the instructions in a recipe one step at a time.

Example: If you’re cooking and the recipe says, “Chop the vegetables, then cook the rice,” you can’t start cooking the rice before chopping the vegetables. You do everything in order.

In code: If a function takes time (like reading a file or making a request), the program will wait until that function finishes before moving on to the next thing.

2. Asynchronous (Async) Function:
What it is: An asynchronous function allows other tasks to run while it’s waiting for something to finish. It doesn't block the rest of the code from running. It’s like cooking multiple dishes at the same time. While you're waiting for one dish to cook, you can start preparing the next one.

Example: When cooking multiple dishes, you don’t have to wait for one to finish before starting another. You might chop veggies while the rice is cooking.

In code: If a function takes time (like reading a file or fetching data from a website), the program does not wait. It keeps running other code and comes back to the function when it finishes.
